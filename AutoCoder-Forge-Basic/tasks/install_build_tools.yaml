    context: {}

notes:
  - Generates a script that uses winget to install CMake, MinGW, and Git
  - If winget is not available, provides manual download links
  - After installation, restart command prompt and run BUILD_ENTIRE_DAW.bat
  - Ensures all build tools are available with alternatives (MinGW as primary, VS as backup)
  - AutoCoder handles the installation to prevent build stops
